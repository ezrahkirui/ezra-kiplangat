    <h1>My Journey: Ezra Kiplangat</h1>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated <strong>Web Developer</strong> currently pursuing my studies at 
        <strong>Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT)</strong>.
        My fascination with technology started with a simple question:
        <em>How does the internet actually work?</em>
        That curiosity has grown into a passion for building responsive, user-friendly applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Education & Background</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Institution:</strong> Dedan Kimathi University of Technology</li>
        <li><strong>Major:</strong> B.Sc. in Information Technology</li>
        <li><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Web Architecture, Front-end Design, and Software Engineering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Tech Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        My journey began with the basics of <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, 
        where I learned how to structure and style the web.
        As I progressed, I fell in love with <strong>JavaScript</strong> 
        for its ability to bring static pages to life.
    </p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mastering Backend Development to become a full-stack developer.</li>
        <li>Contributing to Open Source projects.</li>
        <li>Building tools that solve local challenges in the Kenyan tech ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors,
        reading about emerging tech, or playing baseball.
