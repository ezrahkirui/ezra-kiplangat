## 👨‍💻 Who I Am
I am a dedicated **Web Developer** currently pursuing my studies at **Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT)**. My fascination with technology started with a simple question: *How does the internet actually work?* That curiosity has grown into a passion for building responsive, user-friendly applications.

## 🎓 Education & Background
- **Institution:** Dedan Kimathi University of Technology  
- **Major:** B.Sc. in Information Technology
- **Focus Areas:** Web Architecture, Front-end Design, and Software Engineering.

## 🚀 My Tech Evolution
My journey began with the basics of **HTML and CSS**, where I learned how to structure and style the web. As I progressed, I fell in love with **JavaScript** for its ability to bring static pages to life. 

Being at DeKUT has provided me with a rigorous environment to sharpen my problem-solving skills and collaborate with other brilliant minds on technical projects.

## 🎯 My Goals
Currently, I am focusing on:
1. **Mastering Backend Development:** To become a full-stack developer.
2. **Open Source:** Contributing to projects that have a positive social impact.
3. **Innovation:** Building tools that can solve local challenges in the Kenyan tech ecosystem.

## 💡 Beyond the Code
When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading about emerging tech, or playing baseball. I believe in continuous learning and always staying curious.
